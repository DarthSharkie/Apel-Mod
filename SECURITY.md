# Security Policy
When reporting any Vulnerability its best to fully invistigate about it and know the ins and outs of it. Look into which versions it affects, what triggers it, whats the vulnerable
piece of code, the platform(s) it affects as well a more information. Be very specific & precise

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Once fully verified that its an exploit, it is important to notify the leader(McBrincie212) or co-leader(s) of the apel team and keep it private
while the vulnerability is getting patched out. After it gets patched out feel free to tell what was the vulnerability, the code piece and other information
regarding it(as it no longer exists)
