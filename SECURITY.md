# Security Policy
When reporting any Vulnerability, it is best to fully investigate it and know the ins and outs of it. 
Look into which versions it affects, what triggers it, what is the vulnerable piece of code, 
the platform(s) it affects (if it even affects), As well as look into even more information. 
Be very specific & precise

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Once fully verified that it is an exploit, it is important to notify the leader(McBrincie212) or co-leader(s) of the 
apel team and keep it private while the vulnerability is getting patched out and being fully fixed. 
After it gets patched out, feel free to tell what was the vulnerability, the code piece and 
other information regarding it (as it no longer exists)
